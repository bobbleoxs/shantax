      <description>I. What is withholding tax? Withholding tax (&amp;ldquo;WHT&amp;rdquo;) refers to an amount of tax withheld at source at a certain rate determined by local tax law. Typically, the rate also varies if the seller and buyer are situated in two countries and there are specific double tax treaties between the tax authorities, respectively.
WHT can be applied to different types of remuneration, such as dividend, interest, royalty, commission, fees and rentals, as well as transactions, i.</description>

      <description>I. What is HS code? International trade relies on HS (stands for Harmonised System) codes to classify goods transported across borders. Incorrect HS code classification may result in penalties and seizure of goods.
HS code is used by all countries globally to classify imported and exported goods down to 6-digit. The HS code is split into three groups of two codes.
 First two digits - categorize product (e.g. garment) Second two digits - classify further (e.</description>

      <description>ðŸ“ŽWhy? Over the years, I set up various blog sites for myself and others using existing services such as Squarespace and WordPress. This year, I want to do something different - making the build process itself a learning journey. It&amp;rsquo;s a good time to do it because of a vast amount of excellent free open-source software available and plenty of tutorials/videos around.
ðŸ“–How? I have some experience with writing in markdown, working with Python and Git.</description>

      <title>Technology for Transfer Pricing (ðŸ—žpublished)</title>

      <description>This article is published on Bloomberg Tax 17 Jun 2021.
My tax technology journey starts with transfer pricing (&amp;ldquo;TP&amp;rdquo;) given much of the TP work involves tailored data analytics and visualisation. For technical correspondence with tax authorities, I also provided econometric based statistical analyses. For multinational companies, TP is a highly visible area of tax with governments agreeing to exchange data and hence many potential technology applications. It is therefore desirable to establish a modern data-driven TP management in-house with a systematic overarching design.</description>

      <description>This blog was first published on medium.com and Analytics Vidhya News Bytes
This blog examines the Analytical Database of Individual Multinational Enterprises (MNEs) and their Affiliates (ADIMA) dataset from OECD to understand the structure and presence of the top 100 MNEs of our time across the world.
Background Visibility of information on Multinational Enterprises (MNEs) has been limited at best despite their significant and growing importance in our daily lives as well as public policy area.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning Governance in Tax</title>

      <description>Many areas of tax incorporated machine learning, but it is not a silver bullet. What are the potential risks of adopting a machine learning approach to replace manual efforts and how could we mitigate such risks? This blog post discusses some governance measures I put in place to address these questions.
Common applications The most frequent machine learning application I came across in tax falls into the category of classification prediction modelling, typically includes:</description>

      <title>Data Visualisation in Tax</title>

      <description>Tax and finance teams use an excessive amount of dashboards. The contents are often limited to simple bar charts and histograms. However, tax data is multi-dimensional which means the simple two-dimensional representations may no longer be sufficient.
I believe modern data visualisation in tax should increasingly serve the users with more depth in that it could allow users to:
 interact with data, explore and tell a story from the data, and/or; directly enable an action point from the visualisation  I explain this thinking with an example in transfer pricing below.</description>

      <title>Skills for Future Tax Professionals</title>

      <description>*Some updates on this subject are here.
I often hear tax professionals around me wondering what skills our profession should have under the rapid progression of data and technology. The confusion, or more accurately the dilemma seems to be antagonistic option of resourcing established data scientists who adapt to the tax problem domain, or to expect tax professionals to learn data analytics, or even deeper.
I suspect similar questions are on many non-tech industry professionalsâ€™ mind.</description>

      <title>CBCR Analysis</title>

      <description>Background OECD&amp;rsquo;s BEPS project Action 13 provides a template for multinational enterprises (&amp;ldquo;MNEs&amp;rdquo;) to report annually and for each tax jurisdiction in which they do business the information set out therein. This report is called the Country-by-Country Report (&amp;ldquo;CBCR&amp;rdquo;). The CBCR template requires two tables of MNEs&#39; financial and operational information.
Exploratory data analysis In the first year of submitting CBCR, I wanted to use Python instead of Excel to see how one may get more insights from the data collected in CBCR.</description>
