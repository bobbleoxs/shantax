      <description>üìéWhy? Over the years, I set up various blog sites for myself and others using existing services such as Squarespace and WordPress. This year, I want to do something different - making the build process itself a learning journey. It&amp;rsquo;s a good time to do it because of a vast amount of excellent free open-source software available and plenty of tutorials/videos around.
üìñHow? I have some experience with writing in markdown, working with Python and Git.</description>

      <title>Data Visualisation in Tax</title>

      <description>Tax and finance teams use an excessive amount of dashboards. The contents are often limited to simple bar charts and histograms. However, tax data is multi-dimensional which means the simple two-dimensional representations may no longer be sufficient.
I believe modern data visualisation in tax should increasingly serve the users with more depth in that it could allow users to:
 interact with data, explore and tell a story from the data, and/or; directly enable an action point from the visualisation  I explain this thinking with an example in transfer pricing below.</description>

      <title>Skills for future tax professionals</title>

      <description>*Some updates on this subject are here.
I often hear tax professionals around me wondering what skills our profession should have under the rapid progression of data and technology. The confusion, or more accurately the dilemma seems to be antagonistic option of resourcing established data scientists who adapt to the tax problem domain, or to expect tax professionals to learn data analytics, or even deeper.
I suspect similar questions are on many non-tech industry professionals‚Äô mind.</description>

      <title>CBCR Analysis</title>

      <description>Background OECD&amp;rsquo;s BEPS project Action 13 provides a template for multinational enterprises (&amp;ldquo;MNEs&amp;rdquo;) to report annually and for each tax jurisdiction in which they do business the information set out therein. This report is called the Country-by-Country Report (&amp;ldquo;CBCR&amp;rdquo;). The CBCR template requires two tables of MNEs&#39; financial and operational information.
Exploratory data analysis In the first year of submitting CBCR, I wanted to use Python instead of Excel to see how one may get more insights from the data collected in CBCR.</description>
