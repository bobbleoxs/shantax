      <description>üìéWhy? Over the years, I set up various blog sites for myself and others using existing services such as Squarespace and WordPress. This year, I want to do something different - making the build process itself a learning journey. It&amp;rsquo;s a good time to do it because of a vast amount of excellent free open-source software available and plenty of tutorials/videos around.
üìñHow? I have some experience with writing in markdown, working with Python and Git.</description>

      <description>Many areas of tax incorporated machine learning, but it is not a silver bullet. What are the potential risks of adopting a machine learning approach to replace manual efforts and how could we mitigate such risks? This blog post discusses some governance measures I put in place to address these questions.
Common applications The most frequent machine learning application I came across in tax falls into the category of classification prediction modelling, typically includes:</description>

Background Visibility of information on Multinational Enterprises (MNEs) has been limited at best despite their significant and growing importance in our daily lives as well as public policy area.</description>

      <description>Amidst the discussion on Pillar 1 of the OCED BEPS initiative on Digital Tax, I attended the public consultation in Paris in April 2018. To detail what my thinkings were, I published an article on Bloomberg Tax Management International Journal.</description>

      <title>Data Visualisation in Tax</title>

      <description>Tax and finance teams use an excessive amount of dashboards. The contents are often limited to simple bar charts and histograms. However, tax data is multi-dimensional which means the simple two-dimensional representations may no longer be sufficient.
I believe modern data visualisation in tax should increasingly serve the users with more depth in that it could allow users to:
 interact with data, explore and tell a story from the data, and/or; directly enable an action point from the visualisation  I explain this thinking with an example in transfer pricing below.</description>

      <title>Skills for Future Tax Professionals</title>

      <description>*Some updates on this subject are here.
I often hear tax professionals around me wondering what skills our profession should have under the rapid progression of data and technology. The confusion, or more accurately the dilemma seems to be antagonistic option of resourcing established data scientists who adapt to the tax problem domain, or to expect tax professionals to learn data analytics, or even deeper.
I suspect similar questions are on many non-tech industry professionals‚Äô mind.</description>

      <title>CBCR Analysis</title>

      <description>Background OECD&amp;rsquo;s BEPS project Action 13 provides a template for multinational enterprises (&amp;ldquo;MNEs&amp;rdquo;) to report annually and for each tax jurisdiction in which they do business the information set out therein. This report is called the Country-by-Country Report (&amp;ldquo;CBCR&amp;rdquo;). The CBCR template requires two tables of MNEs&#39; financial and operational information.
Exploratory data analysis In the first year of submitting CBCR, I wanted to use Python instead of Excel to see how one may get more insights from the data collected in CBCR.</description>
