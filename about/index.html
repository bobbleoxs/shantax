<p>Welcome to my personal website. By profession, I am a <strong>tax innovation lead,</strong> based in the bustling <strong>City of London</strong>, UK.  The website was originally set up to host my writings on tax and <strong>tax technology</strong> to keep track of things I learned at work. It gradually grew into a place where I put all my writings on work, technology, and pretty much everything I find interesting enough to dig a bit deeper 🤓</p>
<p>Some of my writings are published but if you are curious about all the random stuff that fascinated and inspired me from <strong>hardware</strong> to <strong>travel,</strong> you should definitely join my newsletter - which, will be rather sparse throughout the year.</p>
<p><strong>About me:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>💻 works full time as Tax Technology Lead, straddling tax/finance and data science/engineering;</li>
<li>🌎 has travelled to 52 countries, mostly solo;</li>
<li>🎨 has been drawing since 4 years old and has never quite given up - currently learning Japanese woodcut prints (Ukiyo-e) (2023);</li>
<li>🛠️ graduated from a Product Foundry program at Brite Brighton as the first cohort in June 2022 and started my maker journey using 3D printer (FDM and resin), laser cutter (Trotec Speedy 300) and CNC machines;</li>
<li>🧵 started taking creative sewing projects (fabric and leather) more seriously since Jan 2022, currently learning pattern cutting;</li>
<li>📚 translated and published three books in mainland China - Breakfast with Lucien (2015), The Burglar Who Counted the Spoons (2018), and Broken Window (2019);</li>
<li>🇨🇳🇯🇵 can speak Mandarian Chinese natively and some basic Japanese;</li>
<li>🙇🏻‍♀️ is always learning something new, every day.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are on the more serious side, you can see my CV/resume here 👉 ⬇️ <a href="https://github.com/bobbleoxs/shantax/blob/master/static/uploads/Shan%20Sun%20Mar%2023.pdf" title="Download as PDF">Download as a PDF</a>.</p>
