<p>Welcome to my personal website. By profession, I am a <strong>tax innovation lead,</strong> based in the bustling <strong>City of London</strong>, UK.  The website was originally set up to host my writings on tax and <strong>tax technology</strong> to keep track of things I learned at work. It gradually grew into a place where I put all my writings on work, technology and pretty much everything I find interesting enough to dig a bit deeper 🤓</p>
<p>Some of my writings are published but if you are curious about all the random stuff that fascinated and inspired me from <strong>hardware</strong> to <strong>travel,</strong> you should definitely join my newsletter - which, will be rather sparse throughout the year.</p>
<p><strong>About me:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>💻 works full time as Lead for Tax Innovation, straddling tax/finance and data science</li>
<li>🌎 has travelled to 49 countries, mostly solo</li>
<li>🎨 has been drawing since 4 years old and has never quite given up</li>
<li>📚 translated and published three books in mainland China</li>
<li>🇨🇳🇯🇵 can speak Chinese fluently and some basic Japanese</li>
<li>🙇🏻‍♀️ is always learning something new, every day</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are more on the serious side, you can see my CV/resume here 👉 ⬇️ <a href="https://github.com/bobbleoxs/shantax/blob/master/static/uploads/ShanSun%20-%20Resume.pdf" title="Download as PDF">Download as PDF</a>.</p>
