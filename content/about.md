## Hiya, I'm **Shan 👩🏻‍💻**!

##### 

Welcome to my personal website. By profession, I am a **tax innovation lead,** based in the bustling **City of London**, UK.  The website was originally set up to host my writings on tax and **tax technology** to keep track of things I learned at work. It gradually grew into a place where I put all my writings on work, technology, and pretty much everything I find interesting enough to dig a bit deeper 🤓

Some of my writings are published but if you are curious about all the random stuff that fascinated and inspired me from **hardware** to **travel,** you should definitely join my newsletter - which, will be rather sparse throughout the year.

**About me:**

* 💻 works full time as Lead for Tax Innovation, straddling tax/finance and data science
* 🌎 has travelled to 49 countries, mostly solo
* 🎨 has been drawing since 4 years old and never given up
* 📚 translated and published three books in mainland China - Breakfast with Lucien (2015), The Burglar Who

  Counted the Spoons (2018), and Broken Window (2019) 
* 🇨🇳🇯🇵 can speak Chinese fluently and some basic Japanese
* 🙇🏻‍♀️ is always learning something new, every day
