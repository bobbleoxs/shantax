On 23 Feb 2023 I gave a short talk at the PyCon Namibia hosted at Kleines Heim in Windhoek. It was my first time in Namibia and everything was unfamiliar and exciting. I've also volunteered some time at the coding teaching charity [Humble Data's workshop](https://humbledata.org/event/pyconna2023.html). I was hugely impressed by the professionalism and diligence from the attendees, some of whom are still at high school!
