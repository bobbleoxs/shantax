On 23 Feb 2023 I gave a short talk at the PyCon Namibia hosted at Kleines Heim in Windhoek. It was my first time in Namibia and everything was unfamiliar but exciting. I've also volunteered some time at [Humble Data's workshop](https://humbledata.org/event/pyconna2023.html). Humble Data is a charity which organises free workshops for people who are outside of the mainstream in the data science and tech industry. Over the 4-day conference, I was hugely impressed by the professionalism and diligence from the attendees, some of whom are still at high school!

Many people asked for my slides after I finished the talk. It is a little late but my talk slides on "How To Find Your Career Niche" for PyCon Namibia 2023
can be [downloaded here](https://github.com/bobbleoxs/shantax/raw/master/static/uploads/Finding%20Your%20Career%20Niche%20slides.pdf). I very much hope I will come back to do this again - until next time!
