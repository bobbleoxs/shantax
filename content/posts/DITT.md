+++

I am thrilled to finally lift the curtain on a project that has been in the making for the past year and a half - the launch of the Chartered Institute of Taxation's (CIOT) innovative new qualification, the [Diploma in Tax Technology (DITT)](https://ciotditt.tsc.events/)! üçæüéä This has truly been a labour of love and a project I am immensely proud of.

The journey towards the creation of the DITT started years ago, while working alongside generous colleagues who were always willing to share their wisdom and experiences. Their support was pivotal in my professional progression, and as the pandemic hit, I felt a strong desire to give back to the profession that had given me so much.

In a chance conversation with Helen Whiteman, the CEO of the Chartered Institute of Taxation (CIOT), I offered my help to CIOT in developing something new around tax technology to educate future tax professionals. This shared vision led to the inception of the Diploma in Tax Technology, aimed at bridging the knowledge gap for tax professionals in this digital age.

Collaborating with the dedicated team at CIOT (big shout to Roz, Paul and Ian) to bring this groundbreaking qualification to life has been an enlightening and rewarding experience. I'm grateful for the opportunity to contribute to a project that is pushing the boundaries of tax education.

As we celebrate the launch of the DITT, I am excited about its potential to empower our profession and hopt DITT will equip tax professionals with the skills necessary to navigate the technology-driven landscape of taxation, at the very least, as a starting point. Here's to a new chapter in tax education, and remember - the future belongs to those who prepare for it today! ü•≥
